# More-Efficient-Randomized-Exploration-for-Reinforcement-Learning-via-Approximate-Sampling
Thompson sampling (TS) is one of the most popular exploration techniques in reinforcement learning (RL). However, most TS algorithms with theoretical guarantees are difficult to implement and not generalizable to Deep RL
